Once upon a time, there was a boy named Jack. Jack lived in a small village with his mother and father. They were poor and often went hungry. One day, Jack's father told him they would have to sell their only cow at the market. Jack was upset and asked if there was another way. His father told him that their cow was their only source of income and that they would starve without her.<br><br>The next day, Jack took their cow, named Milky, to the market to sell. On the way, he met an old man who offered to give him magic beans in exchange for the cow. Jack thought this was a strange request, but he agreed, hoping the beans would bring him good fortune. When he returned home, he gave the beans to his mother, who planted them in the garden. That night, a massive beanstalk grew all the way up to the clouds.<br><br>The following morning, Jack climbed up the beanstalk and reached a kingdom in the sky. There lived a giant and his wife. Jack entered the house and found the giant's wife in the kitchen. She gave him food and shelter, and soon after, the giant came home. The giant was big and frightening, but Jack was brave and said, "I have come to claim the treasure that you have stolen from my father."<br><br>The giant chased Jack, who ran and hid inside. The giant's wife helped Jack again, and he found the goose that laid golden eggs. Jack took it and escaped down the beanstalk.<br><br>Back home, he gave the goose to his parents, and it laid eggs that brought them wealth. Jack's parents were happy, but Jack was curious about the giant's kingdom in the sky. Soon after, he returned to the giant's home, and again, the giant's wife was kind to him. This time, Jack stole a magical harp that sang beautiful songs. But the giant woke up, and Jack had to escape, leaving the harp behind.<br><br>The giant's wife was angry with Jack for stealing from her husband. She tricked him into returning to the giant's house by pretending she had information about his father. When Jack arrived, the giant caught him and put him in a bag to take to the king to have him hanged.<br><br>In the bag, Jack met a friendly fairy who helped him by turning the bag into a parachute, allowing Jack to escape. He fell into a river, which took him to the king's court. There, the king's daughter was looking out the window and saw Jack. She was immediately smitten, so she saved him and hired him as her personal assistant.<br><br>Eventually, Jack married the princess and became a prince. He and his parents moved into the castle, and they lived happily ever after.
