It was the first day of fourth grade for Jimmy and Timmy. They sat in the back of the classroom, trying not to giggle too much. <br>The teacher was going over the syllabus and supplies list with a stern expression. They had just moved to the town from Los Angeles and were anxious to make some friends. The boys couldn't help but feel a little nervous about the year ahead. What if the other kids didn't like them? What if they struggled in class? <br>The teacher noticed them squirming in the back and called on them to answer a question. They hesitated, unsure of the answer. The rest of the class giggled at their mistake. <br>Feeling embarrassed and frustrated, the boys tried to pay closer attention to the lesson. But it was hard. They couldn't stop thinking about recess and the possibilities for adventure on the playground. They glanced at each other, both of them wondering if they'd made a mistake by moving here.  <br>Just then, the bell rang. It was time for recess. Jimmy and Timmy practically jumped out of their seats, excitement washing over them. As they ran out the door and onto the playground, their anxiety and worry disappeared. Here was a place they knew how to operate.<br>They spotted a group of kids playing tag and joined in. Before long, they were laughing and running with the others. For a moment, they forgot they were the new kids.<br>By the time the recess lady blew the whistle, signaling for them to go back inside, Jimmy and Timmy had made a few new friends and were feeling much better about their new school.  <br>When they returned to the classroom, they felt ready to learn. They raised their hands, answered questions, and participated in class discussions. The teacher even complimented them on their improvement.<br>At the end of the day, as they walked home, Jimmy turned to Timmy and said, "You know, I think we're going to like it here."<br>Timmy grinned and nodded, "Yeah. Me too."
