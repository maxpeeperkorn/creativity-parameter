It was a dark and stormy night, and Jack was all alone in his creaky old house. The wind howled and the rain pounded against the windows, making him feel nervous and jumpy.<br><br>Suddenly, he heard a knock at the door.<br><br>"Who could that be?" Jack wondered.<br><br>He slowly made his way to the front door, his heart pounding in his chest. When he opened it, he was surprised to see a small, bedraggled kitten standing on his porch.<br><br>"Hello there, little guy," Jack said, bending down to pet the kitten.<br><br>The kitten looked up at him with big, round eyes and purred contentedly. Jack couldn't resist, so he scooped up the kitten and brought him inside.<br><br>As the night wore on, Jack and the kitten became fast friends. They played with a ball of yarn, chased each other around the house, and even cuddled up together on the couch.<br><br>The storm raged on outside, but Jack and the kitten were happy and warm inside their little haven.<br><br>As the night wore on, the storm finally began to pass, and the rain slowed to a gentle patter.<br><br>"I think it's time for you to go home, little guy," Jack said, reluctant to part with his new friend.<br><br>But the kitten didn't want to leave. He rubbed up against Jack's leg and purred even louder.<br><br>"Alright, alright," Jack said, laughing. "You can stay."<br><br>And so, the kitten stayed with Jack, and they lived happily ever after.<br><br>The end.
