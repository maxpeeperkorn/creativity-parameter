A long time ago, there was a woman named Sarah who lived in a cabin in the woods. She had no electricity or running water. She spent her days chopping wood and hauling water from the spring. She was happy, but she was also lonely.<br>One day, Sarah was out gathering firewood when she heard a rustling in the bushes. She turned to see a large brown bear emerging from the underbrush. Her heart racing, she slowly backed away from the bear, intending to run back to the safety of her cabin. But her legs wouldn't move. She was frozen in place.<br>The bear approached her, its eyes fixed on her. Sarah could see the intelligence in those eyes, and she knew that the bear was not going to hurt her. Slowly, the bear came closer and closer, until it was right in front of her. It sniffed her gently, then nuzzled her hand.<br>Sarah was still afraid, but she felt a sense of wonder, too. She had never been this close to a wild animal before. The bear seemed to sense her fear and her wonder, and it gently licked her hand.<br>Sarah's fear melted away, and she found herself petting the bear's soft fur. She felt a deep connection to this wild creature, and she knew that she had been given a gift.<br>The bear stayed with Sarah for hours, and she fed it berries and honey from her cabin. As the sun began to set, the bear slowly made its way back into the forest. Sarah watched it go, feeling grateful for the unexpected encounter.<br>From that day on, Sarah and the bear became unlikely friends. They would spend hours together, exploring the forest and sharing food and stories. Sarah learned that the bear's name was Max, and she knew that she had found a true companion in this wild and wonderful creature.
