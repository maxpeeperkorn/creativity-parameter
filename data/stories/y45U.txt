It was a dark and stormy night. A young boy named Tim was walking down a long and winding road, but he did not know where it would take him. The trees towered above him, their branches stretching out like skeletal fingers, creaking and groaning in the wind. Tim's heart was racing, but he told himself to keep going.<br><br>Suddenly, a bolt of lightning flashed across the sky. Tim felt the ground tremble beneath his feet. A moment later, a large oak tree crashed to the ground mere feet away from him. Tim gasped and leapt backward. <br><br>He knew he had to find shelter fast. But there was no house in sight. No town. Only the endless rows of trees stretching out in every direction. The wind howled and the rain pounded against him. Tim thought about how this was how the story of the Three Little Pigs began. Then a strong gust almost knocked him down. <br><br>He scanned his surroundings quickly and saw a little cave in the side of a hill just off the road. He ran for it as fast as he legs could carry him and stepped inside just as the rain started to come down in sheets.<br><br>Tim waited, catching his breath, and listening to the tempest raging outside. He could feel the force of the wind trying to dislodge the rocks and soil that made up his meager shelter. He worried that perhaps this had not been the best idea. Just as he thought about making a dash for it back to the road, he heard something else. It sounded like someone humming a tune. He waited a moment to be sure he wasn't just hearing things and then it came again. It was definitely coming from deeper in the cave. Tim edged further in.<br><br>The cave was bigger than it had appeared from the outside, stretching far into the hillside. It was darker, too, now that he had stepped away from the entrance. Tim took slow, tiny steps forward. The humming was louder now, but Tim still couldn't quite make out the tune. It sounded happy, at any rate. Tim told himself that only a good person could hum a happy tune in a time and place like this. <br><br>He took another step forward. That was when he heard the clink of metal against metal. Suddenly, the air around Tim began to illuminate itself softly, as though glowing. The humming stopped. Tim froze. His heart was pounding so hard he worried whoever was in here with him would be able to hear it too. The glow grew brighter until Tim could see that he was standing in a small chamber deep in the cave. A girl was sitting cross-legged on the ground, with a small knapsack at her side. Her eyes were fixed intently on a small crucible set into an iron tripod, and her lips were pressed together in a thin line. <br><br>Tim looked at the crucible and gasped. A small star was dancing inside it, its light shining brilliantly against the cave walls. It was the source of the soft illumination. The girl looked up, surprised, and her eyes locked onto Tim's. Her eyes were just as brilliant, just as bright as the light from the crucible. <br><br>She stood up quickly and picked up the crucible. Tim could see the star inside it flickering faster, as though it sensed her alarm. "Who are you?" she asked in a fierce whisper. She seemed ready to run at a moment's notice, though Tim couldn't fathom where to.<br><br>Tim tried to make his voice sound friendly, "My name is Tim. I got caught out in the storm and was just looking for a place to wait it out. I didn't mean to interrupt. I'll go right away ifâ€”"<br><br>But she had already relaxed, a small smile playing on her lips. "It's all right. I was just surprised. My name's Elara. Do you want to wait out the storm here with me?" <br><br>Tim couldn't believe his luck. This mysterious girl had just offered to share her shelter with him, a complete stranger. It didn't make sense. But Tim wasn't going to complain. He smiled at Elara, feeling the tension drain out of his muscles for the first time in hours.<br><br>"I'd like that," he said.<br><br>The two of them sat on the cave floor together, watching as the star in the crucible continued to flicker and shine, casting a warm, golden light over their faces. Tim felt a sense of wonder and contentment he had not felt in a long, long time.
